I'm Pam, an aspiring **frontend developer** with a background in marketing.

Previously, I worked with startups, SMEs and non-profits, helping them grow their user base through content and growth marketing. I‚Äôve done everything‚Äîfrom working with influential bloggers to handling branding and PR for F&B ventures to managing a podcast on digital health and more.

Everything was smooth sailing until I got bitten by the programming bug and realised there was no turning back.

I'm currently teaching myself frontend development and React (Vue's next on the list). My goal is to join an engineering team who will give me the support in becoming a better developer and to contribute towards building a product or service that makes a difference.
