#Hi there, I’m Pam.

##When I’m not on the prowl for a good waffle in Kuala Lumpur, I use content marketing to help great companies woo new users and make their current ones love them even more.

No two gigs are ever the same. I’ve done everything from working with a celebrity blogger, handling branding and PR for whimsical F&B ventures, spreading the importance of learning English.. and then some. I’ve even helped a unicorn startup with their email marketing.

Here’s what I do most:

- **Content strategy** and **content marketing**
- **Email marketing**
- **Social media management**
- **Copywriting** and **editing**
- A little **growth hacking**
- And some **design** and **coding** on the side

When it comes to clients, I’m a *less is more* kind of person. Trying to juggle 42 different projects at the same time isn’t quite my cup of [teh tarik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teh_tarik).

Yes, I work remotely, but I rather not be *‘that content person somewhere over there in Asia who writes us a thousand words a month’*. I’m here to work with your team to help you do content marketing that can actually help you grow.

Think we’d be a good match? Let’s have a chat: #swiperight and find me below or send a good old-fashioned [email](mailto:pam.desilva@gmail.com).
