I'm Pam, an aspiring **web developer**.

Previously, I worked with startups, SMEs and non-profits, helping them grow their user base through content and growth marketing. I’ve done everything—from working with influential bloggers to handling branding and PR for F&B ventures to managing a podcast on digital health and more.

I'm currently teaching myself frontend development and have been enjoying building mini projects with React. Eventually, I'd like to join a engineering team which fosters growth and a positive culture, enabling me to contribute towards building a product or service that makes a difference.
