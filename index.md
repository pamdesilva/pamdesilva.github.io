I'm Pam, self-taught **web developer**. I've been learning and working with Javascript since May 2017 with a particular focus on React, single-page apps (and ES6 of course).

Before starting my career as a developer, I worked in marketing and PR, helping startups, SMEs and non-profits to grow their user bases through content and growth marketing.

My most recent project was working with the team at [Hanno](https://hanno.co) to build a large healthcare app with React.

I'm currently a part of [BT FurtHER](https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/bt--cfg-digital-intensive.html), a full-time coding bootcamp focusing on full-stack development: from web frontend to Python, databases and TDD, running until **February 2019**.

I'm now looking for my next Junior Development role&emdash;hungry to be a part of a team who are using modern web technologies and able to give me the opportunities and support I need in order to grow into an experienced software developer.
